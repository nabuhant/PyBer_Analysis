# Overview of the analysis
## Background
Old analysis in module
## Purpose 
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

# Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.  
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

# Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.


1.) Provide Urban drivers extra comission for late night pickups and drop.  

2.) Allow urban drivers to provide outstation services as per their convenience. (same model can be applied for suburban and rural city types)  

3.) In rural and suburban areas though the average fare per driver is more compared to urban areas but the no. of rides and total drivers are less compared to urabn cities. So we can introduce a discount scheme for the customers and an incentive scheme for ther driver based on the number rides completed respectively. This will help increase the number rides especially in the rural areas where the number of rides are 125 comapred to urban's 1625
