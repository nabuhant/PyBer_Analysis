# Overview of the analysis
## Background
As a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, a project is carried out to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and to create compelling visualizations for the CEO, V. Isualize. The data is merged to one DataFrame where the columns are the city, city type (rural, suburban, & urban), fare, date & time of ride, unique riide id, and driver count in each city.  
The data was analysed and using Python's Matplotlib libray visualized into:  
**1 -** A scatter plot demonstrating relationship between the average fare to total number of rides per city (categorized by city type and sized by number of drivers per city). Figure is below.

**2 -** The data's measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) along with the outliers were visualized using box-and-whisker plots. This was done for the number of rides, fares, and number of drivers, all by city type. An example is below for the ride count date visualization.

**3 -** Also pie charts were used to visualize the % of total fares, the % of total rides, and the % of totaal drivers, all by city type. An example is below for the % of total drivers by city type.

All figures described above can be found in the [analysis folder](/analysis)
 ## Purpose T
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

# Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.  
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

# Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.


1.) Provide Urban drivers extra comission for late night pickups and drop.  

2.) Allow urban drivers to provide outstation services as per their convenience. (same model can be applied for suburban and rural city types)  

3.) In rural and suburban areas though the average fare per driver is more compared to urban areas but the no. of rides and total drivers are less compared to urabn cities. So we can introduce a discount scheme for the customers and an incentive scheme for ther driver based on the number rides completed respectively. This will help increase the number rides especially in the rural areas where the number of rides are 125 comapred to urban's 1625
